# RLS Policy Update Results

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Table**: `public.business_cards`
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Completed

## Execution Summary

All RLS (Row Level Security) policies for the `business_cards` table have been successfully updated using the Supabase Management API.

### Policies Applied

| Policy Name | Command | USING Check | WITH CHECK |
|------------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Public can view active business cards | SELECT | `is_active = true` | - |
| Users can create own business cards | INSERT | - | `auth.uid() = user_id` |
| Users can delete own business cards | DELETE | `auth.uid() = user_id` | - |
| Users can update own business cards | UPDATE | `auth.uid() = user_id` | `auth.uid() = user_id` |
| Users can view own business cards | SELECT | `auth.uid() = user_id` | - |

## What Changed

### 1. Removed Duplicate Policy
- **Dropped**: "Anyone can view active business cards" (conflicting with new policy)

### 2. Recreated User View Policy
- **Policy**: "Users can view own business cards"
- **Purpose**: Authenticated users can view their own business cards
- **Condition**: `auth.uid() = user_id`

### 3. Added Public View Policy
- **Policy**: "Public can view active business cards"
- **Purpose**: Anyone (including anonymous users) can view active/published business cards
- **Condition**: `is_active = true`

### 4. Ensured CRUD Policies
- **CREATE**: Users can only create business cards with their own user_id
- **UPDATE**: Users can only update their own business cards
- **DELETE**: Users can only delete their own business cards

## Security Model

### Authenticated Users Can:
- ✅ View their own business cards (regardless of `is_active` status)
- ✅ Create new business cards (with their own user_id)
- ✅ Update their own business cards
- ✅ Delete their own business cards

### Anonymous/Public Users Can:
- ✅ View active business cards (`is_active = true`)
- ❌ Cannot create, update, or delete any business cards
- ❌ Cannot view inactive business cards

## Testing

You can test the policies with the following queries:

### Check Current User
```sql
SELECT auth.uid() as current_user_id;
```

### Test Business Card Creation
```sql
-- This should work if you're authenticated
INSERT INTO public.business_cards (
    user_id,
    name,
    title,
    company,
    phone,
    email,
    is_active
) VALUES (
    auth.uid(),
    'Test Name',
    'Test Title',
    'Test Company',
    '010-1234-5678',
    'test@example.com',
    true
);
```

### Test View Own Cards
```sql
-- Should return only your cards
SELECT * FROM public.business_cards WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

### Test Public View (as anonymous)
```sql
-- Should return only active cards
SELECT * FROM public.business_cards WHERE is_active = true;
```

## Files Modified

- `c:\Users\bamboo\mobile-business-card\react-app\FIX_RLS_POLICIES.sql` - Original SQL script
- `c:\Users\bamboo\mobile-business-card\react-app\execute-rls-fix.cjs` - Helper script for display
- `c:\Users\bamboo\mobile-business-card\react-app\execute-sql-via-api.sh` - Execution script

## Execution Method

Policies were applied using the Supabase Management API:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/{project_ref}/database/query" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "..."}'
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test business card creation in your React application
2. ✅ Test viewing business cards as authenticated user
3. ✅ Test public viewing of active business cards
4. ✅ Test update/delete functionality

## Verification

Run this query to verify all policies are in place:
```sql
SELECT
    policyname,
    cmd,
    qual as using_check,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'business_cards'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

Expected result: 5 policies as listed in the table above.

**Result**: ✅ All policies successfully applied and verified.
**Application Status**: Ready for business card CRUD operations.
